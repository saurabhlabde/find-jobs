    "description": "# **Overview **\n\nAt Segment, we believe companies should be able to send their customer data wherever they want, whenever they want, with no fuss. We make this easy with a single pipeline that collects, stores, filters, transforms, and sends data to hundreds of business tools with the flip of a switch. Historically, we’ve built integrations with more than 250 different customer data tools ourselves(think Mixpanel, Google Analytics, Stripe).This March, we opened up our [++**Developer Center**++](https://segment.com/partners/developer-center/). For the first time, new companies could build integrations upon Segment data, using our self-service workflow. In that time, we’ve onboarded **60 separate companies**, each of whom built endpoints to work with our spec. We're now looking for a Senior Fullstack Engineer to help us expand our platform…we want to offer every kind of developer (partners, customers, and indie devs) the means to use Segment data. \n\n## **Project we are working on:**\n\nWe want to give our users and partners:\n\n- the ability to submit custom logic which we run as part of a high-throughput pipeline (think high throughput Lambda at 1/1000th the cost)\n- the ability to query Segment data on the fly, from a big multi-tenant database (online data of our user’s users)\n- new superpowers to combine, modify, and transform data coming through the pipeline (createa visual chain of transformations and steps)\n\nWe want to do all of this across a pipeline which processes hundreds of thousands of events per second for some of the worlds largest brands, like Github, Nike, and Intuit.\n\n## **What We Do:**\n\n- We implement [++high-performance data pipelines with Go, Kafka, and Docker++](https://segment.com/blog/allocation-efficiency-in-high-performance-go-services/)\n- We’re focused on building incredible developer experiences, with tools like our debugger, [++event delivery view++](https://segment.com/blog/new-data-visibility-features/), and asynchronous client libraries.\n- We want to give our users ‘data superpowers’\n- We handle [++billions of messages per day++](https://segment.com/blog/introducing-centrifuge/), putting a [++premium on correctness++](https://segment.com/blog/exactly-once-delivery/)\n\n## **Who** **We're** **Looking** **For:**\n\n- You come from a background of delivering projects from start to finish\n- You love the challenge of building a platform, where users will surprise and delight you with what they build\n- You feel relatively comfortable up and down the stack (both frontend and backend)\n\n## **Tools we use:**\n\n- AWS (EC2, ECS, RDS, S3, and more!)\n- Docker\n- GraphQL\n- Typescript\n- React\n\n## **Requirements:**\n\n- Strong track record of delivering product and internal systems\n- Great computing fundamentals\n- Experience at many levels of the stack (building out some frontend and some backend code)\n\nSegment is an equal opportunity employer.

Since our founding in 2013, we've grown to become a profitable, 100% globally distributed team of ~33 high-performing, happy people that are dedicated to building a product our customers love.\n\n\nOur app’s frontend is a single-page JavaScript web app mostly written in React (originally built with Backbone.js). We bundle with Webpack and target only modern browsers. We test with Enzyme and Mocha run via Puppeteer. Our UI updates in near real-time and is written in LESS/CSS (with flexbox and grid layout) using BEM methodology and takes advantage of fun technologies like Websockets and WebRTC. \n\n\nWe care about performance (e.g. route-based code splitting), maintainability, and testability of our frontend code. We sweat the UI/UX details and work collaboratively with the Product team throughout the design process. This means diving into lo-fi Freehand wireframes, and communicating continuously when those ideas are brought to life using Sketch/Abstract and code.\n\n\nOur frontend app is built on top of our REST API & GraphQL endpoints. Our backend [tech stack](https://stackshare.io/close-crm/close) consists of Python/Flask, MongoDB, Postgres, Elasticsearch, and Redis.

You have significant experience with REST APIs and thoroughly understand HTTP requests. You have experience participating in code reviews and providing overall code quality suggestions to help maintain the structure and quality of the codebase.\nYou should have great product sense and be able to think through user experience issues before diving into the code, and you exhibit a love for great UI.\n\n\nYou’re comfortable working in a fast-paced environment with a small and talented team where you're supported in your efforts to grow professionally. You are able to manage your time well, communicate effectively and collaborate in a fully distributed team.\nYou are located in an American or European time zone.\n\n### **Bonus points if you...**\n\n- Experience implementing real-time (e.g. websockets, polling, etc.) web apps\n- Experience working with GraphQL endpoints\n- An eye for design and experience with Sketch, Abstract, Photoshop, or similar\n- Led small project teams building and launching features\n- Contributed open source code (core or plugins) for a popular frontend framework such as React, Vue, or Angular\n- Built B2B SaaS products\n- Experience with sales or sales tools\n\n### **Come help us with projects like...** \n\n- Conceiving, designing, building, and launching new user-facing features\n- Working with Twilio's API, WebSockets, and WebRTC to improve our [calling features](https://close.com/calling/)\n- Building user-facing analytics features that provide actionable insights based on sales activity data\n- Improving real-time collaboration user experience\n- Expanding our frontend GraphQL usage\n- Extending our React component library\n\n### **Why work with us?** \n\n- 100% Remote (we believe in trust and autonomy)\n- 2 x Annual Team Retreats ([Lisbon Retreat Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKjyXMz-q-Q&feature=youtu.be))\n- Competitive salary\n- Medical, Dental with HSA option - 99% premiums paid (_US residents_)\n- 5 Weeks PTO + 6 Government Holidays + Dec 24 - Jan 1 Company Holiday\n- Parental Leave (10 wks primary caregiver / 4 wks secondary caregiver)\n- 401k matching at 4% (_US residents_)\n- Paid 1 month Sabbatical after 5 years \n- [Our story and team](https://close.io/about/)\n- [Glassdoor Reviews](https://www.glassdoor.co.uk/Reviews/Close-io-Reviews-E1155591.htm) \n\nAt Close, everyone has a voice. We encourage transparency and practicing a mature approach to the work-place. In general, we don’t have strict policies, we have guidelines. Work/Life harmony is an important part of our organization - we believe you bring your best to work when you practice self care (whatever that looks like for you).\n\n\nWe come from 12 countries and 14 states; a collection of talented humans rich in diverse backgrounds, lifestyles and cultures. Twice a year we meet up somewhere around the world to spend time with one another. We see these retreats as an opportunity to strengthen the social fiber of our community.\n\n\nThis team is growing in more ways than one - we’ve recently launched 8 babies (and counting!).

We are looking for a 40 hour per week commitment, but if you would prefer to do a 32 or 24 hour week that could be an option for the right candidate. There would need to be at least 4 hours overlap with a 9:00am - 5:00pm window in GMT.\n\nIt would also be an advantage if you can meet up somewhere close to Clare (Limerick, Galway etc) on a semi-regular basis (twice a month).\n\nNo agencies please.\n",

We spend our time thinking about how to give a global workforce complete control of their own work life while automating the hundreds of thousands of man hours which would normally be required to manage people on this scale.\n\nWe do this using React & Typescript on the frontend backed up by GraphQL servers, some written in Ruby and Rails and some in Elixir and Phoenix.\n\nBusinesses ranging from the largest high-street retailers to five star hotels and independent coffee boutiques rely on Catapult as their casual workforce. If you’ve spent time in a large UK city, you’ve probably been served by a Catapult waiter or sales assistant without even realising it! \n\nWe’re well funded by some amazing investors, our product is live in over 100 locations across the UK and we’ve recently launched in Berlin making us the first and only pan-european player in this space.\n\nOur company values [https://writing.joincatapult.com/our-values/](https://workable.com/nr?l=https%3A%2F%2Fwriting.joincatapult.com%2Four-values%2F) are really important to us and influence every facet of how we work together.\n\n**Things we’ve been working on recently**\n\nNo two days are ever the same in a startup, but to give you a flavour of what we’ve been up to recently:\n\n- Standardising on React, Typescript and GraphQL across our suite of applications\n- Using Kubernetes to automatically deploy standalone environments for our feature branches, complete with anonymised production data\n- Applying machine learning to the billions of data points we generate each year to completely obsolete the interview process\n- Preparing the entire Rails, Phoenix, React and React Native environment for Globalization\n\n**About the role**\n\nWe’ve been growing rapidly over the last three years and as we continue our international roll out, we’re looking for ambitious engineers to help us build the future of work. Our engineering principles [https://writing.joincatapult.com/engineering-principles/](https://workable.com/nr?l=https%3A%2F%2Fwriting.joincatapult.com%2Fengineering-principles%2F) give a good feel for how we work together and what we value. \n\nWe’re a distributed, remote first engineering organisation with team members in Prague, Warsaw, London, Bristol and Bangkok. We work in autonomous pods, each of which has ownership of one area of our business. We’re open to remote applicants from anywhere within the EU.\n\n## **REQUIREMENTS**\n\n**About You**\n\n- Your real passion is for the front end, finding ways to deliver innovative, polished user experiences and you’re experienced supporting this by working in either Ruby & Rails or Elixir & Phoenix backends\n- You’re excited about the potential technologies like GraphQL and Typescript have to speed up and improve the process of building complex client side applications\n- You really buy into the importance of getting things into the hands of a user quickly and then iterating\n- You actively think about when to incur technical debt and when to pay it back\n- You like to explore new technologies and have a keen eye for when something new can add real business value \n- You’ve probably spent most of your time over the last few years focussed on building React applications\n- You’re in favour of, but pragmatic about, automated testing. You like all production grade code to have good test coverage but understand when it may make sense to test MVP’s with a lower degree of test coverage\n- Bonus points for experience with Typescript / GraphQL \n\n## **BENEFITS**\n\nAs well as being a part of a well funded startup at one of the most exciting phases of it’s growth, you’ll get:\n\n- Competitive salary + stock options + 25 days paid holiday per year\n- A strong approach to professional development and mentorship, everyone has a dedicated L&D budget for books, training and the like\n- Several product retreats per year where the whole team goes on a team retreat, looks back on how we can improve and then spends a week or so hacking on new ideas and exploring new technologies\n- Regular social events & the opportunity to travel to our other offices\n- Company Macbook Pro which you’re free to take home \n- A flexible work environment focussed on output not hours\n",

You’ll join a team focused on building a delightful e-commerce and in-store experience and fostering the most welcoming community to discuss skin care and makeup. At Glossier, we work in product teams that ship features to production early, then iterate based on internal and customer feedback. We pay attention to performance, write tests for our code, and care about design. We are also mindful of building an inclusive culture, where decisions are made transparently and we support each other's learning and growth. We’ve built our own point-of-sale application for iOS, and it’s relied upon to power our [NYC, LA and pop-up stores](https://www.glossier.com/locations). It processes millions of dollars in transactions, and we have an exciting roadmap of improvements for the application to improve the experience for staff and customers in stores. Glossier is also working on a to-be-announced application, and we’re looking for engineers who are interested in shaping the direction of a greenfield product. \n\n### **Our Technology Stack**\n\n- Swift for our point-of-sale application and future projects\n- GraphQL for our API\n- React, Redux, Webpack, and Apollo on the frontend\n- Ruby on Rails for the backend\n- AWS to host our infrastructure\n- Postgres, Redis, and Redshift\n\n### **In this role, during your first month you'll:**\n\n- Connect with an onboarding buddy, who’ll help you settle in by introducing you to team members throughout Glossier.\n- Learn about Glossier’s engineering principles through pairing sessions with developers.\n- Work within a product team to ship a well-tested feature or enhancement to production. We love using feature flags to control how changes are rolled out.\n\n### **During your first three months you'll:**\n\n- Deploy frequent improvements, and maybe break something! We have a blameless post-mortem process so that when things go wrong, we can make our systems and processes more resilient.\n- Set personal development goals with your manager, using our publicly available [Engineering ladder](https://medium.com/glossier/building-an-engineering-ladder-at-glossier-e7fc3a390695) as a guide. We have tracks for Individual Contributors and Managers, so you can grow in your career no matter where your interests lie.\n\n### **During your first year you'll:**\n\n- Be a flag-bearer of our diverse and inclusive culture.\n- Make meaningful additions to a variety of projects of increasing complexity.\n- Contribute to an RFC (Request for Comments) proposal (or create your own) that improves our team's culture, processes, or architecture.\n- Give a tech talk. We hold internal talks every two weeks – it’s an opportunity for team members to show their work and present on topics relating to our practice.\n- Write a blog post on [Into The Tech](https://medium.com/glossier), our Technology team’s blog.\n\n### **You:**\n\n- Have a reputation for being inclusive, innovative, clever, fun, and thoughtful. :)\n- Are motivated by working in a fast-growing, dynamic, and iterative environment.\n\n### **About your application and the interview process:**\n\nGlossier is an equal opportunity employer and we value diversity. We do not discriminate on the basis of race, religion, color, national origin, gender, sexual orientation, age, marital status, veteran status, or disability status. If you’re unsure about your qualifications for this position, we still encourage you to apply. We’re looking for engineers who have experience, but know that not everyone’s had a chance to work with the technologies in our stack.

    "description": "## Who are we?\n\nYou'd be joining a team made up of talented people from all over the world, and from many different backgrounds. \n\nWe work together to build TweetDeck, the product for professionals and power users who do Twitter at scale.\n\nWe care about making work happy and productive for everyone, with the option to work from home when you need, wellness benefits, regular #NoMeetingThursdays, #FocusTuesdays, and 6 months of parental leave. See our team member Andreas's [++Moment++](https://twitter.com/i/moments/826789348901269504) for more insight into team lunches, fun and lego building.\n\nWe love sharing knowledge and ideas. Within TweetDeck, we have fortnightly learning seminars. We regularly get together with the other Twitter UK engineering teams for tech talks. And there are many study groups you can join, the most recent being for Machine Learning.\n\n## What we’re excited about\n\nYou'll be joining TweetDeck at an exciting time, both technically and for our users. \n\nWe're currently exploring some brand new projects, which will mean building lots of cool new features.\n\nWe're also the first team to adopt Twitter's new GraphQL API – an exciting opportunity to explore big workflow improvements for the whole team, as well as getting to work on services that will transform Twitter engineering. \n\n## Community love\n\nThere’ll be plenty of opportunities to get involved in the tech community if that’s your thing. We regularly teach [++Code First: Girls++](http://www.codefirstgirls.org.uk/) courses, coding workshops for high school students, and recently hosted [++Codebar++](https://codebar.io/)’s annual conference and bi-monthly [++blackgirl.tech++](http://home.blackgirl.tech/) events. There is a [++Hacks/Hackers++](https://www.meetup.com/HacksHackersLondon/) meetup for journalists (big TweetDeck users) and engineers at Twitter UK every month. And we have company-wide #TwitterForGood days.\n\n## The tech stack\n\nThe codebase is really exciting. Tweets in columns sounds simple, right? But there is a whole world of complexity and logic to providing tweets and interactions in near-real-time. You'll constantly stumble into new areas and have opportunities to discover other parts of the Twitter codebase. There will always be something new to learn.\n\nWe have a microservices architecture, with a modern and clean backend codebase since our recent move from Python to Scala. We aim to write code that’s clear and efficient and make the best use of Scala’s object-oriented functional mix. You’re not expected to know Scala before you join (most of us didn’t), but to be keen to learn – our team includes experience with everything from Java, to Perl, to Clojure, to Ruby. \n\nWe use [++Finatra++](https://twitter.github.io/finatra/) as a framework for creating fast and testable HTTP services, which itself builds on the [++Finagle++](https://twitter.github.io/finagle/)RPC and [++TwitterServer++](https://twitter.github.io/twitter-server/). \n\nWe’ve also been introducing GraphQL to support our near-real-time delivery of events. \n\nOn the data analytics side, we use [++Scalding++](https://github.com/twitter/scalding) and Hadoop for learning about users and their behavior.\n\n## Who are you?\n\nFirst off, you don’t need a Computer Science degree to apply. We are keen to welcome applicants from all backgrounds. In fact, many people on the team don't have a CS degree or any degree for that matter. Our take-home code samples are real world and practical and require the kind of problem-solving that you will use on the job.\n\nBelow are some of the things we like to see in our applicants. The list might seem exhaustive, but don’t let it scare you off. If you’re passionate about services at scale and Twitter, and you think you might be who we're looking for, we encourage you to apply.\n\n## What we’re looking for:\n\n- You care about helping users succeed in their goals through the features you build\n- You take a collaborative approach to work closely with and incorporating feedback from, product, design, and engineering\n- You've mentored others, whether in your work or outside of it and are keen to support colleagues to learn and grow\n- You can work both autonomously and as part of a team, including collaborating closely with engineers in remote offices\n- You are interested in challenges at scale\n- You have shown the ability to learn new programming languages, and/or have prior experience in a JVM-based and/or functional programming language\n- You’re constructive and supportive in code reviews\n- You’re disciplined about testing, quality assurance and writing clear, helpful documentation\n- You are able to be self-directed and drive features and systems from technical design through to production\n- You can build relationships with other teams and leverage opportunities to collaborate\n- You’re willing to be periodically part of out-of-hours on-call schedule; we’re flexible if you need to change times - it’s about collectively supporting and owning services we create\n\nWe are committed to an inclusive and diverse Twitter. Twitter is an equal opportunity employer. We do not discriminate based on race, color, ethnicity, ancestry, national origin, religion, sex, gender, gender identity, gender expression, sexual orientation, age, disability, veteran status, genetic information, marital status or any legally protected status.\n",

That’s why we want to hire you now.\n\n\n\nFormidable in London is looking for developers who may not have a traditional software development background. We’re eager to take a chance on smart, motivated people with a demonstrated ability to get functional web apps to clients. This role provides on-the-job training doing real work for real clients with coworkers who are actively pushing the boundaries of the modern open-source web.\n\n\nYou've been exploring the modern JavaScript stack—tools like Node, GraphQL, React, or React Native. You’re ready to take on bigger projects with higher coding requirements, and we’re ready to give them to you.\n\n\nAt Formidable, you’ll build bleeding-edge web apps at scale. You’ll work across the full stack, from server-side APIs to client-side UI. You’ll be involved in the development process from brainstorming all the way through to production. Above all, you’ll level up in your craft: work with powerful technologies, get frequent code reviews from your friendly veteran colleagues, and learn from continuing-education programs. Soon, we hope, you’ll be a senior engineer who runs projects, leads a team, and mentors aspiring developers who are where you are today.\n\n\nHow will we know you have potential to grow in this role? You already have completed projects to your name. You care about what we care about: clean code, sensible architecture, and readability over cleverness. And you’re OK with being uncomfortable, admitting when you don’t know something, and working with others to get better. Software engineering is difficult, and we’ll expect you to learn quickly and meet our high standards.\nStill sound good? Let’s talk.\n\n\n**What You’ll Do**\n• Join a Formidable team as an engineer\n• Gather requirements\n• Write clean, readable code, mostly Javascript\n• Write tests\n• Expand your full-stack development knowledge\n▾ React\n▾ React Native\n▾ Node\n▾ GraphQL\n• Collaborate, give and receive feedback, and grow\n\n\n**What You Have**\n• Portfolio of completed projects—websites or apps\n• Drive to learn and grow\n• Understanding of engineering for the web: client/server architecture, REST, etc.\n• Front-end experience:\n▾ HTML5 & CSS3\n▾ DOM manipulation\n▾ Some experience with React\n\n\n**Extra Credit**\n• Experience gathering requirements & interfacing with clients\n• Familiarity with standard design patterns, data structures, and algorithms\n• React Native or Native mobile development\n• Code school graduate and/or CS Background\n\n\n\n\n**Formidable** is a Seattle, Denver, and London-based boutique engineering consultancy and open source software organization, specializing in React.js, React Native, GraphQL, Node.js, and the architecture of large-scale JavaScript applications.
